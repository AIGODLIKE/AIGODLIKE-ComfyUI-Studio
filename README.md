## How to install(Only on WINDOWS 10\11)
AIGODLIKE-ComfyUI-STUDIO is equivalent to a custom node, you can use any method you like, just put it in folder custom_nodes

Then run:
```sh
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/AIGODLIKE/AIGODLIKE-ComfyUI-Studio.git
```
## How to use it
Find a loader, **left click** on model switch to pop up ComfyUI Studio Manager. If you still need to use the original model list, use **Shift+left** click on model switch to pop up the original model list
## List of supported loaders
1 **Standard Node**: Automatically supports ComfyUI official nodes and standard named * custom node types, which will be automatically taken over when they need to access the models folder.

Standard names: ckpt_name,vae_name,clip_name,gligen_name,control_net_name,lora_name,style_model_name,hypernetwork_name,unet_name.

2 **Non-standard nodes**: Some developers have redefined the model loader for some purpose, which means that non-standard naming prevents the program from automatically adapting and requires manual adaptation, which requires some time and feedback to be added to the support list
